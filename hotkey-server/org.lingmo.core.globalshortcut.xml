        BindShortcuts:

        @shortcuts: The list of shortcuts to bind

        Bind the shortcuts. This will typically result the portal presenting a
        dialog showing the shortcuts and allowing users to configure the shortcuts.
        An application can only attempt bind shortcuts of a session once.

        Each element of the @shortcuts array is a tuple composed of a shortcut id,
        and a vardict with the following keys:

        * ``description`` (``s``)

          User-readable text describing what the shortcut does.

        * ``preferred_trigger`` (``s``)

          The preferred shortcut trigger, defined as described by the
          `shortcuts XDG specification <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shortcuts-spec/latest/>`__.
          Optional.


        The following results get returned via the signal:

        * ``shortcuts`` (``a(sa{sv})``)

          The list of shortcuts which were bound. This is a subset of the
          shortcuts which were passed in from the @shortcuts variable of this
          method (this includes the set of all shortcuts and the empty set).
          The keys they may contain are described below, and are different from
          the keys in the @shortcuts variable of this method.

        Each element of the @shortcuts array returned by the signal is a tuple composed of
        a shortcut id, and a vardict with the following keys:

        * ``description`` (``s``)

          User-readable text describing what the shortcut does.

        * ``trigger_description`` (``s``)

          User-readable text describing how to trigger the shortcut for the
          client to render.
